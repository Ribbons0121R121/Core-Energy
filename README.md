# Core Energy
Fun lil mindustry mod series for v7 im working on, one part of many to come so far. Made from the perspective of how a planet conquring tech base maker would handle from my perspective, this handy lil mod will allow you all your base needs straight from your core!

# Wheres the release?
simply put, this mod is H E A V I L L Y in development and my perfectionate ass wont release it till its fully done. you can build your own by download and zippinf if you feel like it, feel free to report bugs or balance issues if found. except for the monument. im aware it neeeds a nerf

#HEY, thats my sprite!
yes, im terrible at spriting. so tahts why ive done a buncha resprites to not look at a buncha ohnos. if you see your sprite here, it just means that i like it enough to use it. unless someone wants to volunteer to either help me learn to sprite gud or sprite for my mod then itll stay like this.

#overide bad, music bad, ew file size
just remember this is a multi part mod, as in itll ship as multiple files as add ons. obviously the core mod is gonna be bloated as hell.

#good lord this is terrible
yes, this is my first mod, i am VEYR much aware of how bad it is, but it will i m p r o v e.

cant beleive im saying this but thank you to the peeps in modding-general for sticking up with my dumbassery and bullshit to this point. sh1p especially, its the thought that counts.








also fuck you aur you dont own colors
